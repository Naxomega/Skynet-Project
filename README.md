TERMINATOR Project is a DIY robot that uses a Raspberry Pi as its microcontroller It's a school project with some of my friends. There will be 2 files (or 3) TERMINATOR Lib, which is a custom Python library, and TERMINATOR Auto, to make the robot autonomous. (and the 3rd file is a dashboard, with camera access and manual control, and it's a friend who wrote that code)
